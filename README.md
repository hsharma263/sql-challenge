# sql-challenge
The code in this repository is an introudction into SQL. The data used in this assignement consisted of employee data from the 1980s and 90s of the famous Pewlett Hackard company. Using PostgreSQL, tables were created, data was imported, and queries were run to analyze the data. Prior to this however, an ERD was generated, in order to help visualize the relationships and keys between the various tables. A screenshot of this can be found in the sql-ERD.png file. The .sql files containing the queries is found in the EmployeeSQL directory. The employee_db_tables.sql file contains the code for creating the tables. The employee_db_data_analysis.sql file contains the code for the queries. Lastly, part of the data was visualized in Jupyter Notebook, using Pandas and Matplotlib. A historgram of the salary ranges and a bar chart of the average salary is found in the Salary_Histogram.ipynb file.
